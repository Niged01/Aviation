Welcome Niged01,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Final Design
-------
Insert responive design screen test

## Objective
--------
Design an interactive website quiz using JavaScript along with HTML and CSS, front-end site that responds to a user’s actions.

The client needs in this project are made purely for the purpose of completing my Code Institute project.

## Brief
---------
The end goal of this website is to provide an interactive Aviation themed quiz. The site should include:

-	An emotive enjoyable interactive quiz written in JavaScript.
-	A plethora of questions relating to mainly commercial Aviation 
-	Score boards, leader board and progress tally throughout the quiz
-	A consistent layout and design

## Ux – User Experience Design 
---------
### User Requirements 

User or users wanting a quiz on aviation to play on their flights or with mates as a pub quiz get together or just enjoying alone time for a bit of enjoyment.

User wants a light hearted approach that is not requiring in depth questions on aviation more of a broader general public experience of Aviation 

Base quiz purely of large commercial airlines and aircraft 

### Initial Concept

Aviation brings enjoyment to a lot of people, knowing this I hope to build a fully functioning quiz around aviation using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I anticipate using a colour scheme of blues and white’s indicative of flying through calm blue skies I will develop this concept further down the tract as the site functions come together. I see the site being easy to navigate. This quiz is designed to fit across all user screens.

Wire frames if I have time


## Colour Scheme
------
With the back ground colour, I have chosen a pastel lighter blue to give the feeling the user is in the sky 

With the buttons and headings, I have chosen shades of white indicative of fluffy white clouds

Further colours chosen Green for correct quest answers red if not 

Font kept black to fit with theme.



## Typography
--------
The font I have chosen to use on this site is Roboto Mono from google fonts. The reason behind choosing this font is upon seeing I immediately reminisce about old airline movies where in the 1970s the boards were analogue with flight details evoking and uplifting nostalgic feeling that I would like the users to be evoked with. It should almost feel to the users like they are sitting in an airport lounge waiting for their flight to be called.
